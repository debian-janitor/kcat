Description: producer and consumer for Apache Kafka
 kcat is a generic non-JVM producer and consumer for Apache Kafka
 0.8, think of it as a netcat for Kafka.
 .
 In producer mode kcat reads messages from stdin, delimited with a
 configurable delimiter and produces them to the provided Kafka
 cluster, topic and partition. In consumer mode kcat reads messages
 from a topic and partition and prints them to stdout using the
 configured message delimiter.
 .
 kcat also features a Metadata list mode to display the current
 state of the Kafka cluster and its topics and partitions.
